    <h2>Introduction to Watson Assistant (30 min)</h2>
    <p>In the next lab you will be working on creating a Student Advisor Chatbot. So, before you move on to the next lab we would like to introduce you to the basic terminology/concepts of the Watson Assistant which will help you in understanding the next lab better.</p>
    <p>We assume that you already have completed the previous course: Building AI Powered Chatbots Without Programming. However, even if not then this reading article will take you through some of the main concepts that you will be dealing with.</p>
    <p><strong>What is an Assistant?</strong></p>
    <p>An assistant is a cognitive bot to which you add skills that enable it to interact with your customers in useful ways.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0106EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203-coursera/images/Step1.png" width="600" style="border: solid 1px grey; padding-left=20px">
    <p>In the previous lab(Part-3) you already created a Watson Assistant Instance. So, now it's time to add some Dialog Skills to the chatbot.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Dialog Skill?</strong></p>
    <p>A dialog skill is a container for the artifacts that define the flow of a conversation that your assistant can have with your customers. A dialog skill uses Watson natural language processing and machine learning technologies to understand user questions and requests, and respond to them with answers that are authored by you.</p>

    <p>After, creating your Dialog SKills you wil be adding intents to your Watson Assistant.</p>
    <p><strong>Intents:</strong></p>
    <p>Intents are purposes or goals that are expressed in a customer's input, such as answering a question or processing a bill payment. By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.</p>
    <p>You can create your own intents or can use the built-in intents.</p>
    <p><strong>Content Catalogs</strong> provides an easy way to add common intents to your Watson Assistant dialog skill. Intents you add from the catalog are meant to provide a starting point. Add to or edit the catalog intents to tailor them for your use case.</p>

    <p>Now, next we add some entities to our Watson Assistant.</p>
    <p><strong>Entities:</strong></p>
    <p>Entities represent information in the user input that is relevant to the user's purpose.</p>
    <p>If intents represent verbs (the action a user wants to do), entities represent nouns (the object of, or the context for, that action). For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.</p>
    <p>When you add a dialog to your dialog skill, the following dialog nodes are added to it automatically:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Welcome:</strong> Defines how the assistant greets the user and starts the conversation.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Anything else:</strong> What the assistant says when a customer's request cannot be satisfied by any of the defined intents.</p>
    <p>Now, you can start adding your nodes to the chatbot as per your requirement. After you have finished creating your nodes, you can test the chatbot through the <strong>Try It Out</strong> pane and see if it recognizes your intents as you expect.</p>
